# C# WPF Basic Calculator

This project is a Basic Calculator application built using C# and WPF. It allows users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The interface is user-friendly, with large buttons and a clear display. Built using Visual Studio, this project leverages XAML for the UI and C# for the backend logic.
